# NumpySineWave
Generate a sin wave with random phase and amplitude.

Write python code that generates a sin wave with random phase and amplitude. It should four arguments: 
a) x_left the left endpoint for the x range
b) x_right 
c) x_dim the number of points between x_left and x_right. These points should be linearly spaced. 
d) seed. A seed value for generating the sin waves. Giving the same seed should produce the same sin.
